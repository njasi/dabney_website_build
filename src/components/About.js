              Welcome to Dabney! Here, you can usually find people doing sets in
              the gazebo or library and hanging out in the lounge, talking or
              screening movies. We have a massive collection of board games to
              play, and a large pile of squashy objects in the lounge, called
              the bear pit. We just finished a new mural in the house, many
              darbs (as Dabney members are known) are artistically or musically
              inclined.

              Surviving Caltech isn't always easy. Sometimes you just need to
              take some time out of your your day to have a good laugh. Here at
              Dabney, our family of eccentric Darbs have cultivated a space that
              makes all of us feel at home. You have any crazy ideas, like
              driving up a mountain to bring back snow to Dabney's courtyard? Or
              racing your friends across campus in wheeled trash can-based "hot
              tubs"? Or barricading the house against invading zombies (members
              of Venerable)? If you get enough support, we'll probably turn it
              into one of our weekly social events!
            </p>

              We hold some other large events, including the Pumpkin Drop, where
              we drop LN2 frozen pumpkins from the roof of the Caltech Hall to
              the sound of the 1812 Overture, our yearly Interhouse (a themed
              party), and a visit to Joshua Tree to watch the stars! In addition
              to these large events we also plan smaller weekly social events at
              the start of each new term.
